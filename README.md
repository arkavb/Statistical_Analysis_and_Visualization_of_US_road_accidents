# Analysis_and_Visualization_of_US_road_accidents
In this project, we have tried to hypothesize and analyse the factors that we believe could cause road crashes. We have tried to answer the questions using descriptive analytics and visualizations to conclude on our hypothesis and furthermore, suggest ways to curb these causes. We hope that our insights will be helpful in raising awareness amongst citizens, policy makers which in turn will be helpful in creating guidelines and policies that promote safer road trips.
